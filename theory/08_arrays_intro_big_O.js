// Big-O of Arrays:
//Method type
// Insertion — It depends. Insertion at the end is O(1). But insertion at the beginning is o(n)
// Removal — It depends. Removal at the end is O(1). But in between or at the beginning is o(n)
// Access — O(1)
// Searching — O(n)
// Big-O of Array methods:

// push, pop — O(1)
// shift, unshift, concat, slice, splice — O(n)
// forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc. — O(n)
